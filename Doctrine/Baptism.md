# Baptism

### Baptism is the ceremonial washing of water. 

Baptism is a reenlightening of an ancient practice.  It symbolizes the burial, cleansing, and resurrection of the believer.

Baptism does not save a person, nor enable salvation.  Rather, it is a declaration of allegiance and a remembrance for prior believers.
