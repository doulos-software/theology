# Doctrine
## secondary essential ideals in the faith that are not necessary for salvation but ought to be wrestled with.

Doctrines are categorized as being essential beliefs which a believer must wrestle with and which may have a salvific component.
There is likely to be some variance in the beliefs _among believers_ but we'll generally find one mainstream position.

Modernization of these views is generally well guarded by scholars.
This is not to say that belief systems are never updated but such must be done by careful research.
