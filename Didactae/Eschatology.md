# Eschatology

### Eschatology is the study of end times.

The central feature of all end-times systems is the return of Jesus Christ to Earth - the second coming - and their ineptitude. 

There is no single system yet developed which accounts for all the applicable scriptural themes and idiomsÂ and their textual bases.
These include: a millenium, a tribulation a rapture,, and the 2nd coming.
