#Commensality

Commensality is the practice of eating socially.  Eating as a family (nuclear and/or extended) is not just about social training and friendship but is a visceral model of nourishment.  Through social eating we share and learn and receive sustenance all at once.  We do not just require nutrients in specific proportions to survive but they must be administered in a certain way.

Thus, the practice of social eating in reverence to the Great Provider is an essential practice of our faith.  The actual methodology of practicing this belief varies widely.
