#Christian Theology

A compilation of christian theological thought.  There are separate branches devoted to particular belief systems.  Topics are divided into three areas:

- Dogma ~ unifying, necessary beliefs
- Doctrine ~ important beliefs which should be studied but have variant valid beliefs
- Didactae ~ tertiary beliefs which are edifying but not essential

The wiki is a glossary of terms with pointers to the repository where more detail is needed.
